This opens up new avenues for growth as more urban populations seek products that cater to their living conditions.</p><p>In the commercial sector, there is an increasing demand for automated dishwashing systems that reduce the manual labor required in kitchens, especially in busy restaurants and hotels. This shift toward automation and the adoption of robotic dishwashing technologies represents a significant opportunity for innovation and differentiation in the market.
